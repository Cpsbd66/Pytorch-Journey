What is deep learning(subset of ML)?
Traditional programming is we have inputs and then alogirthms and we have to figure out the oututs. while machine learning figures out the algorithms(relationship) when input(features) and output(labels) are given.

Why use ML?
=> can we think of all the rules for complex problems ? thats why..

Deep learnign is good for:
- Problems with long rules
- Deep learning can adapt.
- Large collection of data.

When not :
- When you need explainibility.
- When Traditional is better option.
- When errors are unacceptable. (Outputs are not predictables always)
- When there is not huge amount of data.

Machine Learning vs Deep learning
=> Machine Learning -- Structured data (Row, collumns..)
=> Deep learning -- Unstructured data(image, audio, texts..)

Common algorithms: 
- Random forest, gradiant boosted model, Naive bayes, nearest neighbour,.. (ML)
- Neural Network, {fully connected, convolutional, recurrect} Neural Network, Transformer... (DL)

Neural Networks => 
Input => Data to numbers(Numerical Encoding) => passing through a neural netowrk(Learn representation) => representation outputs => Outputs
Anatomy =? Input layer => Hidden layer(s) => Ouput Layer 
Each leayer =? combination of linear and non-linear functions

Types of Learning =>
- Supervised (With huge data)
- Unsupervised & self-supervised (Without labels but with features)
- Transfer learning (Transfering one model's learning to one's)
(There is also Reinforcement Learning)

What is deep learing actually used for ?
=> Recommendation,
translation, sppech recognition=> sequence to sequence, 
computer vision, natural language processing(Like spam or not spam in mail) => Classification/regreesion
